# meridian-algo-flow-mark

`meridian-algo-flow-mark` packages a practical algorithms exercise in OCaml. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Meridian Algo Flow Mark

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Problem Shape

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Internal Model

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The OCaml implementation keeps the data record and functions small enough to load directly in the test file.

## Scenario Walkthrough

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Main Behaviors

- Uses fixture data to keep complexity tradeoffs changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Run It Locally

The only required setup is the local OCaml toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Known Edges

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
